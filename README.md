<h2> My first website for supply chain solution </h2> 
<p> My aim is to handle every company's supply chain like managing their inventory, warehouses, and logistics. </p>
<p> This website mostly focuses on POS (Point of sale) for retail stores. However, this is a different POS system than available in the market. The main difference is this model does not need a barcode and RFID to identify the product, it detects the products by its image.</p>
<p>Your HTML code appears to be a Point of Sale (POS) system interface that utilizes machine learning to detect items through a camera feed and automatically adds them to the system. </p>
